Answer to test assigned by Laureate to job applicant

Software Development Test

The following is an aptitude test is designed to measure your programming and web development skills. 
The test is divided into two parts:

Part I

Create an application in Python and Webapp2 with these requirements:

1. Retrieve all the videos from the YouTube account LaureateChannel in JSON format (Hint: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/channels/list)
2. Show the results
3. Enable a search using the video’s name and description
4. The frontend of this test needs to be developed using AngularJS.
Note: We’re also evaluating your skills about User Experience.

Part II
Upload the project from Part I to Google App Engine or Microsoft Azure. Make sure that the
date and your name is visible somewhere on the page.
You may use any resources you have available. However, partial or total copy-pasted code
is prohibited and could as disqualify you as a candidate for the position. When you submit
this test, you agree that you wrote the code presented and can provide explanations of it if
evaluators ask for them.

You must send your project files, even if you fail to complete Part II. Please save all the files
of your project in a zip file with the name “SDT_MMDD_YourName.zip”, where MM and DD
represents a zero-padded month and day respectively. For example, John Doe’s filename
would be “SDT_0214_JohnDoe.zip”.
